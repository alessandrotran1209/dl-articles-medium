Code repository for my articles on Deep Learning on Medium.com.

Following are the contents:
* **MNIST - ANN - Keras.ipynb**: Multiclass-classification of the MNIST Digits dataset using a Keras based Artifical Neutal Network (a.k.a. Dense Neural Network).
* **MNIST - CNN - Keras.ipynb**: Multiclass-classification of the MNIST Digits dataset using a Keras based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
* **FASHION-ANN-Keras.ipynb**: Multiclass-classification of the Zolando Fashion-MNIST dataset using a Keras based Artifical Neutal Network (a.k.a. Dense Neural Network).
* **Fashion - CNN - Keras.ipynb**: Multiclass-classification of the Zolando Fashion-MNIST dataset using a Keras based Convolutional Neutal Network. Illustrates technique of progressively improving network performance by applying regularization and Image Augmentation.
* **cats_vs_dogs_create_dataset.py**: create a smaller dataset from all images downloaded from Kaggle for the cats-vs-dogs challenge. Our models are trained on this smaller dataset.
* **Cats_vs_Dogs_(Kaggle)_CNN_Keras.ipynb**: My implementation of the Kaggle cats-vs-dogs challengs 
* **kr_helper_funcs.py**: Helper functions for Keras models.
